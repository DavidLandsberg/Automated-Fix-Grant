Automated fix detection is distinct from automated error detection, which has a large area of study, and implemented commerical tools (such as Airbrake~\footnote{\url{https://airbrake.io/}}) Automated fix detection is an entirely new area of study, and will also require integration into pre-existing tools. As of this present moment, no-one has yet attempted to create
an automated fix detection method which combines these methods into a tool as per WP3 and WP4. This would not be
only part of the novelty of our work. More importantly we propose to create a system which sits `on
top' of any existing industrial scale software project, and rely on particular uses of program languages or managerial styles. This makes the methods developed in the project entirely general.
