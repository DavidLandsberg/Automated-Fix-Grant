% project structure here
Our \wptotal{} work packages (WPs) seek to develop the project in the following ways. WP1 examines methods to treat the failure grouping problem. This progresses in concert with WP2 which examimes methods for solving the proving a negative problem. WP3 examines methods to treat the fix classification and statistical problem.  WP4 describes features of the tool which will be implemented as a consequence of the previous packages. 
See Figure~\ref{fig:gantt}.

The main high-level goal of \project{} is to build a  tool which can give comprehensive understanding about fixes, with the main desiderata being that these contribute to a debugging paradigm which is more effective and efficient at delivering information about fixes than if the user did not use the tool.
