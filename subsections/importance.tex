The software sector is a substantial contributor to the growth of the UK's economy. EngineeringUK reports: "\textit{software, IT and telecoms together generated 4.2\% of UK gross value added in 2011 and provided 885,000 jobs. There are 107,000 software businesses, and the UK is the world's number two exporter of telecoms services (£5.4 billion) and number three in computer services (£7.1 billion) and information services (£2 billion)"}.\footnote{\url{https://www.engineeringuk.com/media/1466/enguk-report-2015-interactive.pdf}}

The UK is already world-leading in software engineering. However, at
present there are no UK researchers active in the area of incorporating the scientific method into the software development paradigm. \project{} would put the UK at the forefront of such research. 

Software engineering and programming languages are both considered high priority, growth areas by
EPSRC\@. This project will offer a bridgehead to work of national and international importance.
