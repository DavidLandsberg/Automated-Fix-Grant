\project{} will have a significant impact in software engineering by providing enhanced debugging tools which ensure software is delivered in a more efficient time frame. For software engineering it will identity new lines of research for debugging methods that allow
for improvements in existing and developing approaches. For the fault localisation community it will provide new
notions of explanation, hypothesis, which will form a theoretical foundation to future work. For the verification community it will open up areas of testing which are specific to hypothesis testing. This opens a new range of problems and a new problem domain for how to explain bugs in programs.
