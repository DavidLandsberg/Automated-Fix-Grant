Automated fix detection fits within the field of software engineering (SE) research. The UK is considered a strong contributor to this field, therefore this project will contribute to maintaining UK's top position in SE. 

As software systems grow in scale and complexity, it faces additional challenges when trying to assertain its properties. This project will attack this challenge by developing methods which 

The project will have a significant impact in software engineeringin two ways: by providing enhanced tools and method which ensure software is delivered in a more efficient time frame, and by identitying new lines of research for software development methods involving fix detection. We also expect impact to be had in areas related to the application of AI, given practical applications of methods of causal inference in WP1. 

Outcomes of the project include submissions to the top software engineering conferences and journals. These include ICSE, FSE, ISSTA, and TSE.
